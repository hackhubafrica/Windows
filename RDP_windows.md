If you want to connect to a machine with LAN IP address 192.168.100.204 from a different network with a different public IP address, you typically need to configure your network to allow remote access through your router or firewall. Here’s a general approach on how to achieve this:

Steps to Connect Remotely to 192.168.100.204:
Port Forwarding:

Access your router's configuration page (typically through a web browser by entering the router's IP address, often 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1).
Set up port forwarding to forward incoming traffic on a specific port (e.g., port 3389 for Remote Desktop Protocol, RDP) to the LAN IP address 192.168.100.204. This tells your router to send any incoming traffic on that port to your specific machine on the LAN.
Dynamic DNS (Optional):

If your public IP address is dynamic (changes periodically), consider using a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service. DDNS assigns a fixed domain name to your dynamic IP address, so you can connect using a domain name instead of an IP address that may change.
Firewall Configuration:

Ensure that your firewall (on the router and possibly on the machine 192.168.100.204) allows incoming traffic on the port you’ve forwarded. This step is crucial for security as well; only open necessary ports.
Connect Using Public IP:

Once port forwarding is set up, you can connect to 192.168.100.204 from outside your local network using your current public IP address. For example, if your public IP address is 102.210.221.2, you would connect to 102.210.221.2:3389 (if using RDP) from a remote location.
Example Scenario (Using RDP):
Router Configuration: Set up port forwarding on your router to forward port 3389 (RDP port) to 192.168.100.204.

Firewall Settings: Ensure Windows Firewall on 192.168.100.204 allows incoming connections on port 3389.

Remote Connection: From a remote location, open your Remote Desktop client and enter 102.210.221.2 as the address, specifying port 3389. This directs your connection through the internet to your specified machine (192.168.100.204) on your LAN.

Security Considerations:
Use Strong Passwords: Ensure your machine (192.168.100.204) has a strong password for the user account you're using to connect remotely.

Limit Exposure: Only forward necessary ports and consider using VPNs for secure remote access instead of exposing services directly to the internet.

By following these steps, you can establish remote access to a machine (192.168.100.204) on your LAN from a different network using a different public IP address. Each router’s interface may vary, so consult your router’s manual or support documentation for specific instructions on configuring port forwarding.










Sure, let's dive deeper into the process of connecting to a machine (192.168.100.204) on your local area network (LAN) from a different network using a different public IP address. This scenario often involves configuring port forwarding and understanding how network traffic flows between your local machine and external networks.

Understanding IP Addresses Involved:
Public IP Address:

This is the IP address assigned to your router by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). It's the address used to communicate with devices outside your local network (the internet). You can find your public IP address by visiting websites like https://api64.ipify.org?format=json.
LAN IP Address (Private IP Address):

This is the IP address assigned to a device on your local network. Devices on the same network can communicate with each other using their LAN IP addresses. For example, 192.168.100.204 is the LAN IP address of the machine you want to access remotely.
Steps to Connect Remotely:
1. Configure Port Forwarding:
What is Port Forwarding?

Port forwarding is a technique used to make devices on your local network accessible from outside your network. It involves configuring your router to forward incoming traffic on a specific port to a specific device on your LAN.
Steps to Configure Port Forwarding:

Access Router Configuration:

Open a web browser and enter your router's IP address in the address bar. Common router IP addresses are 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1. You can find this IP address by checking your network settings on your computer.
Log In to Your Router:

You'll be prompted to log in. Typically, you'll use a username and password provided by your ISP or set by you during the initial router setup.
Find the Port Forwarding Section:

This can vary depending on your router's interface. Look for options related to "Port Forwarding", "Virtual Server", or "Applications & Gaming".
Add a Port Forwarding Rule:

Create a new port forwarding rule. You'll need to specify:
Service Name: A descriptive name for the service (e.g., RDP).
Port Range: The external port (e.g., 3389 for RDP) and the internal port (typically the same for most applications).
Protocol: Usually TCP or UDP, depending on the service.
Internal IP Address: Enter 192.168.100.204, the LAN IP address of your machine.
Save Settings: Apply the changes and restart your router if necessary for the settings to take effect.

2. Firewall Configuration:
Windows Firewall (on 192.168.100.204):

Ensure that the Windows Firewall on 192.168.100.204 allows incoming connections on the port you've forwarded. For RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), this is typically port 3389.
Router Firewall:

Check your router's firewall settings to ensure that it allows incoming traffic on the port you've forwarded.
3. Connecting Remotely:
Using Public IP Address:
From a remote location (outside your local network), open your Remote Desktop client or other relevant application.
Enter your current public IP address (e.g., 102.210.221.2) followed by the port number you forwarded (e.g., 102.210.221.2:3389 for RDP).
Security Considerations:
Strong Passwords: Ensure your machine (192.168.100.204) has a strong password for the user account used for remote access.

Limit Exposure: Only forward necessary ports. Consider using VPNs for secure remote access instead of exposing services directly to the internet.

Troubleshooting Tips:
Check Port Forwarding: Verify that the port forwarding rule is correctly configured on your router.

Firewall Settings: Ensure both the Windows Firewall on 192.168.100.204 and your router's firewall allow traffic on the forwarded port.

Dynamic IP Addresses: If your public IP address is dynamic (changes periodically), consider using a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service to map a domain name to your changing IP address.

By following these steps and understanding how to configure port forwarding and firewall settings, you can enable remote access to devices on your local network from outside networks using different public IP addresses. Always prioritize security by using strong authentication methods and minimizing exposure to unnecessary ports.
